# Procedural-Terrain
Scalable, Configurable, Procedural Terrain in Unity

## Summary
A project to explore runtime mesh generation, noise, shaders and more.

## Current Features
Scalable in chunks
- Vertexes per chunk
- Number of chunks
  
Fully customisable noise
- Using layered perlin with octaves
 
Customisable falloff-map for creating islands
- Currently using circular and square falloff

Lowpoly artstyle with uniform lighting and colour across each face
  
Gradient colour with key system

Simple water with reflection and refraction

## Known Issues
Low frame rate due to high vertex amount
Falloff customisation still limited
Colour system is clunky

## Planned Features
LOD system to lower vertex count at further distances
Gradient editor for terrain colour
Water Effects
- Depth blur
- Edge Blur
- Lowpoly lighting
- Blueness

Project started in August 2018
